The documents contain information about the citing documents. Documents that are considered scholarly according to the requirements set out in the paper are marked as such in the 'Final' column.

The 'Audience' column shows the categorization on document type/source. When 'DocumentType' and 'Source' were inconclusive, it was determined on 'Title_Text'.

The 'Scholars' and 'Practitioners' columns refer to usage by users assigned to a university company ID and users assigned to any other type of company ID.

The 'UniversityAffiliations' and 'PractitionerAffiliations' refer to the affiliation(s) of the author(s). An author can have multiple affiliations. Only the author affiliations for documents with 'Audience' Scholars were checked. However, authors can write multiple articles, so affiliations are filled in for all articles of these authors.
