# Citation-Metrics-for-Legal-Information-Retrieval-Systems
Data corresponding to the Citation Metrics for Legal Information Retrieval Systems paper presented at the 8th International Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR 2019)

The documents contain information about the citing documents. Documents that are considered scholarly according to the requirements set out in the paper are marked in boldface.

Document Class is Document Type, except for books and journals. For books and journals the self-reported audience of the publication is considered for Document Class.

The column Usage first shows the usage from the users affiliated with a university (this data includes students as the function of the user is not included in the data), followed by users affiliated to other organization types. Note that the group of users affiliated to a university is much smaller than the group of affiliated to other organisations.

For documents with more than one author, the affiliations of all authors are grouped and shown in the Author Affiliation column.
